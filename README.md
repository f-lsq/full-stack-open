# Full Stack Open
Started this course as a supplement to my software development course, with the aim of sharpening my `React`, `Node.js` and `MongoDB` knowledge and learning `Redux`, and incorporating it into my personal projects. 
The additional stacks such as `GraphQL` and `TypeScript` are also a plus, given its alignment with industry standards.

Initial goal is to complete up to **part 7**.
